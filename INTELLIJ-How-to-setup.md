# How to setup forge workspace in IntelliJ

### FIRST READ THE README.md

Open IDEA, and import project.
Select your build.gradle file and have it import.
Once it's finished you must close IntelliJ and run the following command:

"gradlew genIntellijRuns" (./gradlew genIntellijRuns if you are on Mac/Linux)

Now you can open IntelliJ :D
